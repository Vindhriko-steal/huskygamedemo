If soft locked press ESC

Press SPACE to skip cutscenes

If a box goes out of bounds,
or a rat escapes ANY ROOMS.
The game is considered softlocked

honestly theres like a million bugs probably, i havent had time to test them all
so if anything weird happens, just hit ESC



A couple hints if you cannot figure out the solution to the third level
1. wait and observe the rats
2. the boxes ending position will be on the button right above the closest button to where the player spawns in
3. how do rats interact with boxes?
